<!--
TEMPLATE for a Karazhan night record file. To create a new Karazhan record file, copy this
file from `reference/templates/karazhan-record.md` into `records/` and rename the copy
to `YYYY-MM-DD-{day}-karazhan.md` (e.g. `records/2026-04-15-wed-karazhan.md`). Do
not edit this template in place — only edit the copy under `records/`.

Fill in every placeholder marked {like-this}. Delete every section or sub-line
marked with an HTML comment like `delete line if none` if its condition applies.

Keep the section order as-is — the file-operations-manual and rules assume
this layout.
-->

# Karazhan — {Day} {DD.MM.YYYY}

> {Optional one-line schedule note, e.g. "Switched from the usual day to Wednesday this week."}    <!-- delete blockquote line if not applicable -->

## Signups (from Discord) — {X} (+{Y})

<!--
X = number of players who want to raid (the first number in the Discord header)
Y = number of players signed up as bench/tentative (the parenthesised number)
Total signups = X + Y. Remember: if X > 30, additional players from X must be benched
to bring the active roster down to 30. See rules/02-bench-rotation.md for the selection
algorithm.

## Actual Raid Rosters

<!--
Three teams, each exactly 10 players: 1 MT, 1 OT, 6 DPS, 2 Healers (target).
Team order MUST be: Restaurant, Bakery, BestPrepared (matches rules/01-raid-compositions.md
→ "Team names"). No team is anchored to a specific player. Enchanter distribution across
teams follows rules/03-player-constraints.md → "Enchanters".

The Class column should record what the player ACTUALLY played that night (per the spec
icon in the signup screenshot), not their default spec from rules/04-players.md.
For hybrid-class spec calls, write "Druid (Balance)" or "Druid (Resto)" etc. when it's
not obvious from the role column.

**Composition check:** Target per team: 2T / 2H / 6 DPS = 10. Total target across 3 teams: 30. Actual: {3 teams × actual counts} = {actual total}. Status: ✅ / ⚠️ {explanation if not on target}.

## Dual-spec flex applied                              <!-- delete this whole section if no flex was used -->

<!--
Record any cases where a player was asked to switch to their secondary spec
because the raid was short on a role (per rules/01-raid-compositions.md →
"Handling role shortages"). Tier 1 = explicitly flexible note in 04-players;
Tier 2 = no preference; Tier 3 = reluctance / "absolute last resort" note.
-->

| Player             | Asked to switch from → to      | Tier | Accepted? | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|------|-----------|-------|
| ...                | DPS (Balance) → Healer (Resto) | 2    | Yes       |       |

## Bench ({N})

<!--
Bench count = cumulative count for this player at this raid LOCATION (Karazhan),
INCLUDING this raid. Per rules/02-bench-rotation.md, Karazhan and Gruul+Mag bench
counts are tracked independently.

Reason column — pick one of the valid labels from `rules/02-bench-rotation.md` →
"Bench reason vocabulary" (single source of truth). Do not invent new labels. If
a benching case doesn't fit any defined label, flag it to the user before writing
the record file.

Delete the table and replace with `*(None — all 30 spots filled)*` if no one was benched.
-->

| Player             | Priority | Bench count (cumulative, after this raid) | Reason        |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| ...                | 2        | ...                                       | fair rotation |

## Notes

<!--
What belongs here, what does not, and how to phrase it: see
`reference/file-operations-manual.md` → "Writing the `## Notes` section of a record file"
(single source of truth — do not duplicate that guidance into this template).
-->

- ...

## Loot conflicts

<!--
Per `rules/03-player-constraints.md` — list every item where 2+ competing players
are in this raid (playing or benched). Skip items where fewer than 2 competitors
signed up.

Competitors column: player name + team abbreviation (R / Bak / BP) or (bench).
Status: "✓ split" if all competitors are on different teams (or benched).
"⚠️ X + Y" naming the pair(s) that share a team — these are loot-split violations.

After the table, add a one-line summary: how many items are fully split out of
how many listed, plus a note on whether the violations are unavoidable
(competitor count exceeds team count, interlocking constraint triangles, etc.).
Delete this whole section if no Needlist items have 2+ competitors in
this raid.
-->

| Item                        | Competitors                  | Status                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ...                         | ... (R), ... (BP)            | ✓ split / ⚠️ ... + ...       |

## Sanity check

<!--
Record the sub-agent sanity-check verdict. Canonical rule — when the sub-agent
runs, verdict semantics, and how a fresh check is triggered — lives in
reference/file-operations-manual.md → Step 3.6 of "Build the roster" and
Event: Full-roster recalculation.

Template layout for this section:
  1. **Verdict: {YES / GOOD ENOUGH / NO}** — {one-line summary}.
  2. Bullet list of any violations the sub-agent flagged.
  3. If the roster changed after the latest sanity check without triggering a
     new one, add a "Post-check changes" subsection listing what changed.

Multi-verdict history: the Verdict line reflects the MOST RECENT check; earlier
verdicts, if any, are appended chronologically for audit.

Delete this whole section if no sanity check was performed (e.g. historical
roster data recorded without a roster-building step).
-->

**Verdict: {YES / GOOD ENOUGH / NO}** — {one-line summary}.

- ...

**Post-check changes** (not re-verified by sub-agent):         <!-- delete if no changes after check -->
- ...
