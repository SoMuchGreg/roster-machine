<!--
TEMPLATE for a Karazhan night set file. To create a new Karazhan set, copy this
file from `reference/templates/karazhan-set.md` into `sets/` and rename the copy
to `YYYY-MM-DD-{day}-karazhan.md` (e.g. `sets/2026-04-15-wed-karazhan.md`). Do
not edit this template in place — only edit the copy under `sets/`.

Fill in every placeholder marked {like-this}. Delete every section or sub-line
marked `<!-- delete if … -->` if it doesn't apply.

Keep the section order as-is — the file-operations-manual and rules assume
this layout.

# Karazhan — {Day} {DD.MM.YYYY}

> {Optional one-line schedule note, e.g. "Switched from the usual day to Wednesday this week."}    <!-- delete blockquote line if not applicable -->

## Signups (from Discord) — {X} (+{Y})

<!--
X = number of players who want to raid (the first number in the Discord header)
Y = number of players signed up as bench/tentative (the parenthesised number)
Total signups = X + Y. Remember: if X > 30, additional players from X must be benched
to bring the active roster down to 30. See rules/02-bench-rotation.md for the selection
algorithm.

## Actual Raid Rosters

<!--
Three teams, each exactly 10 players: 1 MT, 1 OT, 6 DPS, 2 Healers (target).
Team order MUST be: Restaurant, Bakery, BaeGlaives (matches rules/01-raid-compositions.md
fixed-assignments table). Fixed players: Mirohl on Restaurant, Glaivemaster Baebay on
BaeGlaives, Greg OR Kres/Dissi on Bakery (the other goes to Restaurant for enchanting).

The Class column should record what the player ACTUALLY played that night (per the spec
icon in the signup screenshot), not their default spec from rules/04-players.md.
For hybrid-class spec calls, write "Druid (Balance)" or "Druid (Resto)" etc. when it's
not obvious from the role column.

**Composition check:** Target per team: 2T / 2H / 6 DPS = 10. Total target across 3 teams: 30. Actual: {3 teams × actual counts} = {actual total}. Status: ✅ / ⚠️ {explanation if not on target}.

## Dual-spec flex applied                              <!-- delete this whole section if no flex was used -->

<!--
Record any cases where a player was asked to switch to their secondary spec
because the raid was short on a role (per rules/01-raid-compositions.md →
"Handling role shortages"). Tier 1 = explicitly flexible note in 04-players;
Tier 2 = no preference; Tier 3 = reluctance / "absolute last resort" note.
-->

| Player | Asked to switch from → to     | Tier | Accepted? | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------------|------|-----------|-------|
| ...    | DPS (Balance) → Healer (Resto) | 2    | Yes       |       |

## Bench ({N})

<!--
Bench count = cumulative count for this player at this raid LOCATION (Karazhan),
INCLUDING this raid. Per rules/02-bench-rotation.md, Karazhan and Gruul+Mag bench
counts are tracked independently.

Reason vocabulary (use one of these — do not invent new values):

  - priority 3        — player is raid spot priority 3 (last resort), benched because all
                        priority-1 and priority-2 signups filled the spots
  - fair rotation     — priority-2 overflow, benched per fair-rotation rule
                        (lowest cumulative bench count for this raid location plays first)
  - composition cap   — benched by a hard composition rule (e.g., 25-man Resto Druid cap)
  - voluntary         — signed up as bench/tentative (+Y) in the Discord screenshot
  - declined flex     — declined a dual-spec swap request when the raid was short on a role
                        (and would otherwise have been needed to fill that role)

Delete the table and replace with `*(None — all 30 spots filled)*` if no one was benched.
-->

| Player | Priority | Bench count (cumulative, after this raid) | Reason         |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| ...    | 2        | ...                                       | fair rotation  |

## Notes

- Raid-specific observations: late signups, exceptions, new players seen for the first time, spec confirmations, anything noteworthy that future sets should know about.
- Use bullets. Keep observations factual. Player-specific learnings (e.g., "X is actually Holy not Disc") should also be propagated to `rules/04-players.md` per the file-operations-manual workflow.
