# 2026-04-11 — Bench rotation tracked per raid location

## Change
`rules/02-bench-rotation.md` — bench fairness is now tracked per raid location (each raid type independently), not as a single overall count. `derived/bench-history.md` was restructured into separate per-raid-location sections.

## Reason
It's unfair if one player is always benched from one raid type but never another. Per-location tracking ensures balanced rotation across raid types.

## Files touched
- `rules/02-bench-rotation.md`
- `derived/bench-history.md`
