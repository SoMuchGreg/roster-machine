# Rule 05 — Encounter Assignments (Gruul+Mag)

## Scope

Applies **only to the Gruul+Mag raid location** (Gruul's Lair + Magtheridon's Lair). Other 25-man raid locations (SSC, TK, Hyjal, BT) will get their own encounter-assignment rules when content unlocks; do not apply this rule to them. For the raid format and raid location definitions, see `config/project.md` → "Terminology".

## When to run

After the Actual Roster is finalized (per `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` and `rules/02-bench-rotation.md`), any Dual-spec flex is recorded, and the sub-agent sanity check has returned a verdict — but **before** the roster is presented to the user for approval. Encounter assignment is a refinement of the roster: it never changes *who plays*, only *what each participant does during the fight*. A player's recorded role in `## Actual Roster` (Tank/Healer/DPS) is independent of the encounter role they hold — e.g., a Healer can hold the "Mage Tank Healer" assignment without ceasing to be a Healer on the sheet.

## Encounter roles

### High King Maulgar (Gruul's Lair — first boss)

A 5-mini-boss council fight. Every mini-boss needs a dedicated tank/handler plus a healer.

| Role                 | Eligibility requirement                            | Count | Notes                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maulgar Tank         | **Must be a core tank**                            | 1     | See *Maulgar Tank assignment* below.                                                                  |
| Maulgar Tank MD      | **Must be a Hunter**                               | 1     | Initial-threat Misdirect at pull. See *Hunter Misdirect (MD) assignment* below for fill conditions.                                              |
| Maulgar Healer       | Any healer                                         | 2     | Always 2 healers. See *Maulgar Healer assignment* below.                                              |
| Mage Tank (Krosh)    | **Must be a Mage** (Spellsteals Krosh's Spell Shield) | 1     | Very strong preference: **OomToDoom**.                                                                |
| Mage Tank Healer     | Any healer                                         | 1     |                                                                                                       |
| Kiggler Tank         | **Balance Druid** (preferred); **else 2 Ranged DPS** | 1 or 2 | Class-based strong preference — not a named player. See *Kiggler Tank assignment* below for the 1-or-2 decision tree. |
| Kiggler Tank Healer  | Any healer                                         | 1     | One healer covers the Kiggler tank(s) regardless of whether it's a solo Balance druid or a 2-ranged-DPS pair. |
| Olm Tank             | Any tank                                           | 1     | Tanks Olm only **until a felhunter is summoned and subjugated**; the warlock's subjugated felhunter then holds Olm. |
| Felhunter Subjugate  | **Must be a Warlock**                              | 1 or 2 | 1 slot if only 1 Warlock is in the roster; 2 slots if 2 or more Warlocks are in the roster. See *Felhunter Subjugate assignment* below. |
| Olm Tank Healer      | Any healer                                         | 1     | Optional if the tank-window is short — leave the Player cell as `—` in the record file if no dedicated healer is assigned. |
| Blindeye Tank        | Any tank                                           | 1     |                                                                                                       |
| Blindeye Tank MD     | **Must be a Hunter**                               | 1     | Initial-threat Misdirect at pull. See *Hunter Misdirect (MD) assignment* below for fill conditions.                                              |
| Blindeye Tank Healer | Any healer                                         | 1     |                                                                                                       |

### Magtheridon (Magtheridon's Lair)

Five cube clickers, one per compass direction, each marked with a fixed raid icon. The Location ↔ Marker mapping below is **fixed** — never reassign markers to different locations.

| Location    | Marker   |
|-------------|----------|
| South       | Star     |
| South East  | Triangle |
| South West  | Circle   |
| North East  | Square   |
| North West  | Diamond  |

## General raid instructions (fixed)

Positioning and kill-order instructions for the Maulgar encounter. Invariant across raids — do not restate in record files (per `CLAUDE.md` → "Key principles" → single source of truth); the record-file template references this section instead.

- **Maulgar:** Melee here after OLM.
- **Krosh:** Ranged here after OLM.
- **Kiggler:** Ranged here after Krosh.
- **Olm:** Kill Second.
- **Blindeye the Seer:** Kill First (Interrupt heals).

## Assignment algorithm

Run this for each role in the Maulgar table (in table order), then for each Magtheridon cube location (in the order **S → SE → SW → NE → NW**). A single player holds at most one role assignment per encounter — not both Maulgar Tank and Mage Tank, and not two slots of the same multi-slot role (e.g., both Maulgar Healer slots). The same player may hold one Maulgar role **and** one Magtheridon cube in the same raid; the encounters run at different times.

1. **Filter by hard constraint.** Drop roster members who don't meet the role's eligibility requirement per the Encounter roles table (e.g., Mage for Krosh Mage Tank, Warlock for Felhunter Subjugate, core tank for Maulgar Tank, Hunter for the MD slots). For roles with no requirement listed, all non-already-assigned roster members are eligible.
2. **Apply continuity preference.** Among the remaining candidates, find those who have held this exact role in prior raids (see *Continuity data sources* below). If one or more is in the roster, pick the **most recent** holder. Tiebreak by total number of prior holds (more = preferred), then alphabetical by canonical player name per `rules/04-players.md`.
3. **Apply explicit strong preferences** when step 2 produces no candidate:
   - **Mage Tank** → OomToDoom if in the roster. (Named-player preference.)
   - **Kiggler Tank** → handled separately by *Kiggler Tank assignment* below — class-based, not named.
4. **Otherwise pick any eligible roster member.** No further heuristic — the raid leader may override when the roster is presented.
5. **Flag to the user** when any of the following applies:
   - A hard constraint cannot be satisfied (e.g., no Mage in the roster for Krosh; no Warlock for Subjugate; fewer than 2 Healers for Maulgar Healer).
   - The continuity candidate is withdrawn or benched but a weaker-continuity candidate is available.
   - The named-player preference (OomToDoom for Mage Tank) is in the roster but a stronger continuity claim from another player pre-empted them — the user may want to reconsider.
   - Kiggler Tank fell back to 2 Ranged DPS because no Balance Druid is in the roster, **and** a Balance druid is signed up but benched — the user may want to swap them in for Kiggler.

### Maulgar Tank assignment

Maulgar Tank's eligibility pool depends on how many core tanks (per `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` → "Core tanks") are in the roster. Filter at step 1 to core tanks (substitute-exclusion at `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` → "Substitutes are not core tanks"), then proceed:

- **0 core tanks in roster** → hard constraint fails; flag to the user (per step 5).
- **1 core tank in roster** → that core tank is assigned Maulgar Tank. Continuity is moot — only one candidate.
- **2 or more core tanks in roster** → run the general five-step algorithm filtered to core tanks.

### Maulgar Healer assignment

Maulgar Healer is a **fixed 2-slot role** — historical data shows 2 healers are always assigned to Maulgar. Run the general five-step algorithm twice, filtering to Healers:

- **Slot 1:** top continuity candidate among available Healers.
- **Slot 2:** next continuity candidate from the remaining Healer pool (slot-1 winner excluded).

If only 1 Healer is in the roster, fill slot 1 and leave slot 2 as `—`; flag to the user via the hard-constraint flag in step 5. If 0 Healers are in the roster, the composition is broken at a level above this rule — `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` → "Handling role shortages" handles that case.

### Kiggler Tank assignment

Kiggler Tank is the one role whose composition depends on roster content: **1 Balance Druid (preferred)** or **2 Ranged DPS (fallback)**. Apply this decision tree **before** running the general algorithm on the role:

1. **Is any Balance Druid in the roster for this raid** (spec determined by the signup screenshot's spec icon or any recorded Dual-spec flex)?
   - **Yes** → treat Kiggler Tank as a **single-player role** filtered to Balance Druids. Run the general five-step algorithm; continuity in step 2 picks the specific Balance druid when multiple are available.
   - **No** → treat Kiggler Tank as **two co-tank slots**. For each slot, run the general five-step algorithm filtered to Ranged DPS (any roster member whose spec this raid is a ranged DPS spec). Continuity from prior records' `## Encounter assignments` sections still applies — a player who has co-tanked Kiggler before retains that claim for one of the two slots.

The preference is **class/role-based, not named-player**: the rule does not hardcode a specific player, so the current Balance-druid main (Beaverfist as of this writing, per `rules/04-players.md`) gets picked by continuity rather than by name — which means the rule stays correct if the guild's Balance-druid pool changes.

Two ranged DPS co-tank is explicitly the fallback; do **not** mix a Balance druid with a ranged DPS as co-tanks. When at least one Balance druid is in the roster, the role is always solo.

### Felhunter Subjugate assignment

Felhunter Subjugate's slot count depends on how many Warlocks are in the roster:

- **0 Warlocks in roster** → hard constraint fails; flag to the user (no one can subjugate the felhunter, so the Olm Tank holds Olm for the entire fight — a significant strategy shift the raid leader must address).
- **1 Warlock in roster** → 1 slot. Run the general five-step algorithm filtered to Warlocks — the one Warlock holds the slot.
- **2 or more Warlocks in roster** → 2 slots. For each slot, run the general five-step algorithm filtered to Warlocks; exclude any Warlock already assigned to the first slot from candidates for the second. Continuity from prior records' `## Encounter assignments` sections applies per slot. Never assign more than 2 slots even if 3+ Warlocks are in the roster — the cap is 2.

### Hunter Misdirect (MD) assignment

Two Hunter-only MD slots in the Maulgar council: **Maulgar Tank MD** and **Blindeye Tank MD**. Each Hunter casts Misdirection on their named tank seconds before the pull, so the tank's first abilities land with bonus threat. Slot count depends on how many Hunters are in the roster:

- **0 Hunters in roster** → hard constraint fails for both slots; flag to the user. Tanks build initial threat without MD support — workable, but slows the threat lead.
- **1 Hunter in roster** → the Hunter is assigned to **Maulgar Tank MD**; **Blindeye Tank MD** is left `—`. Maulgar always takes priority over Blindeye when only one Hunter is available; continuity is not consulted in this case. The empty Blindeye slot here is expected behavior, not a flagged hard-constraint failure.
- **2 or more Hunters in roster** → both slots filled. For each slot, run the general five-step algorithm filtered to Hunters; exclude any Hunter already assigned to the first slot from candidates for the second. Continuity per slot. The cap is 2 — extra Hunters in the roster don't get an MD slot.

**Slot order**: Maulgar Tank MD is assigned before Blindeye Tank MD (per Encounter roles table order).

**Pre-rule record continuity.** Records pre-dating this rule track MDs as `<Hunter> MD` annotations in the Notes column of tank rows. For continuity purposes, count these annotations the same as the corresponding new-schema MD rows: a `<Hunter> MD` annotation in the Maulgar Tank row counts as a Maulgar Tank MD hold for that Hunter; same for Blindeye Tank. MD annotations on tanks not covered by this rule (Mage Tank Krosh, Kiggler Tank, Olm Tank) are ignored — they have no successor slot.

### Cube clicker assignment

Cube clicker follows the same five steps above, but continuity is scoped **per compass location**: "prior holders of this role" means "prior clickers of this specific location". Additional rules:

- **Core tank reserved for Magtheridon MT.** At least one core tank present in the raid (per `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` → "Core tanks") must remain unassigned to any cube so they can tank Magtheridon throughout Phase 2. Enforced at step 1 of the cube-assignment algorithm: a core tank is eligible for a cube only if at least one other core tank present would remain cube-free after the assignment. Tank substitutes filling a core slot are not core tanks (per `rules/01-raid-compositions.md` → "Substitutes are not core tanks") and remain fully eligible to click cubes.
- **Healers excluded from cube clicking.** A roster member whose role in this raid's `## Actual Roster` is **Healer** is ineligible for any cube. Enforced at step 1 of the cube-assignment algorithm: cube clicking pulls the player off normal duties for the click window, which would create a healing gap during Magtheridon Phase 2. Applies regardless of the player's main spec — a DPS who was dual-spec-flexed into a Healer slot for this raid is still ineligible. The exclusion is cube-specific; healers remain fully eligible (and required) for the Maulgar healer roles per the Encounter roles table.
- **Location-stickiness preference.** A roster member who has clicked at exactly one past location should stay at that location. When a player has clicked at multiple past locations, pick the one they have the highest prior-hold count at; tiebreak by most recent; tiebreak by location order **S, SE, SW, NE, NW**.
- **Cube-experience fallback.** If step-2 continuity finds no past holder of a given direction in the roster, *before* falling through to step 4 ("pick any eligible roster member"), prefer a roster member who has previously clicked at **any** other direction. Rank these fallback candidates by total prior cube holds across all directions (more = preferred), tiebreak by most recent hold at any direction, tiebreak alphabetically by canonical player name. Step 4's "any eligible" fires only if no roster member has any prior cube experience.
- **Assign locations in order S → SE → SW → NE → NW** so players with stickier past locations lock in earlier.
- **Pigeonhole:** 5 distinct cubes, 5 distinct players. The same person never clicks two cubes in the same raid.

### Alternative experienced cube clickers

A reference list of roster members with prior cube experience who are **not** assigned a primary cube this raid — a swap pool the raid leader can draw from if a primary clicker drops mid-fight. Recorded in the Gruul+Mag record file under `### Magtheridon — Alternative Experienced Cube Clickers`; template scaffolding at `reference/templates/gruul-mag-record.md`. Has no effect on roster generation or the cube-assignment algorithm; the list is purely informational.

A player is on the list if and only if all four hold:

1. **In this raid's `## Actual Roster`** (any of `### Tanks`, `### Healers`, `### DPS`). Excludes `## Bench`, `## Withdrawn signups`, and `Tentative`. PUGs (`PUG DPS`, `PUG Heal`) are excluded — `PUG` is a label shared across different humans across raids, so name-based continuity cannot resolve to a specific person.
2. **Has prior cube experience** — at least one prior `records/*.md` file lists their canonical name in the Magtheridon cube-clickers table at any direction. Source: `### Continuity data sources` below.
3. **Not assigned a primary cube this raid** — pigeonhole; a primary clicker is by definition not their own alternate.
4. **Currently cube-eligible** under all hard constraints in *Cube clicker assignment* above — specifically the *Healers excluded from cube clicking* exclusion. The *Core tank reserved for Magtheridon MT* constraint is **not** pre-checked: it depends on which cube a hypothetical swap targets and who is being replaced, so the leader applies it at swap time.

**Sort order:** total prior cube holds across all directions, descending. Tiebreak by most recent prior hold (newer = higher). Tiebreak alphabetically by canonical player name.

**Columns** (mirrored by the template):

- **Player** — canonical name per `rules/04-players.md`.
- **Role** — current `## Actual Roster` role: `Tank` or `DPS`. (Healers are excluded by inclusion criterion 4, so this column never reads `Healer`.)
- **Total cube holds** — count of prior cube assignments across all directions (sum of per-direction counts). Equals the primary sort key; surfaced as a column so the leader can compare candidates' overall cube experience at a glance without summing the per-direction breakdown.
- **Prior cubes by direction** — per-direction breakdown, e.g., `S×2, NE×1`. Sort within the cell by count desc, then by canonical compass order (S, SE, SW, NE, NW). The summed counts must equal the **Total cube holds** value in the same row.
- **Most recent** — `YYYY-MM-DD direction` of the player's latest prior cube hold.

### Continuity data sources

The sole source: **prior `records/*.md` files with an `## Encounter assignments` section**, walked in reverse chronological order by the record's date prefix (most recent first). This includes retro-recorded sections in earlier record files — each such record's section carries an HTML comment identifying the source Discord assignments post and its date. No separate historical corpus exists; the pre-template datasets were distributed into their corresponding records.

## Intentionally out of scope

The following Gruul+Mag mechanics have named player roles in standard TBC strategy, and some appeared in the raid leader's historical Discord assignments posts, but this rule **does not track them** — the user has scoped them out. Do not add them back without explicit user instruction, even if a future research pass re-surfaces them.

- **Gruul the Dragonkiller tank subdivision** (MT on Gruul / OT on Hurtful Strike / 3rd tank for Intervene during Reverberation silence). The 3-tank composition target lives in `rules/01-raid-compositions.md`; who does what during the Gruul fight is a raid-leader call made live, not a pre-raid assignment.
- **Magtheridon Phase 1 add tanks** — the 5 Hellfire Channelers each need a tank; historical raids recorded these per compass direction but this rule does not track them. The raid's tanks pick up channelers ad hoc.
- **Burning Abyssal banishers** — the warlock/hunter/mage crowd control on the Channelers' demon adds; historical raids named specific warlocks for this but this rule does not track them.
- **Blindeye interrupt squad** — Blindeye's Prayer of Mending must be interrupted (the "Interrupt heals" instruction under *General raid instructions*), but no named interrupter is assigned here. The raid leader organizes interrupts live.
- **Magtheridon Channeler interrupt squad** — Shadow Volley and Dark Mending are interruptible during Phase 1; no named interrupter is assigned here.

If the user later wants to track any of the above, add the role to the canonical table under *Encounter roles* and update the record-file template to match — do not create a parallel tracking system.

## Interactions with other rules

- **Encounter assignment never changes `## Actual Roster`.** A Healer assigned to "Mage Tank Healer" is still a Healer on the roster sheet; a Warlock assigned to "Felhunter Subjugate" is still a DPS. The assignment records what they do *during* the fight, not *what they are* in the roster.
- **Hard constraints always win over continuity.** Class/spec requirements (e.g., Krosh Mage Tank requires a Mage; Felhunter Subjugate requires a Warlock; the MD slots require Hunters), the Maulgar Tank core-tank requirement, and the cube reservation that keeps one core tank free for Magtheridon MT all filter the candidate pool at step 1 — continuity applies only within the surviving pool. Example: if OomToDoom doesn't sign up, Mage Tank goes to another Mage in the roster, never to a non-Mage continuity holder.
- **Bench rotation takes precedence.** If a past role-holder is benched, withdrawn, or absent, continuity for that role is unsatisfiable this raid — fall through to the next algorithm step. Never un-bench a player to preserve continuity; `rules/02-bench-rotation.md` always wins.
- **Former-guild players** (`rules/04-players.md` → Former players table) contribute to the historical continuity record but are filtered out at step 1 of every assignment — they are not eligible for any current roster.
- **Record-file update procedure** — where and how encounter assignments are written into the record file lives in `reference/file-operations-manual.md` → Step 3 and Step 4 of "Event: New signup screenshot received", and the structural template at `reference/templates/gruul-mag-record.md`.
