## Needlist

The **Needlist** lists high-value loot drops players want to roll "need" on, paired with the players competing for each drop. Competitors for the same item **must be placed in different Karazhan teams** so they don't compete against each other for the same loot in the same run.

### Maintenance

- **Single-competitor rows are kept.** They record declared interest even when no one else competes. They don't affect the split-across-teams rule on their own, and they don't surface in a set's `## Loot conflicts` section (which filters to 2+ competitors in that raid). When a second player later wants the same drop, the existing row becomes a valid conflict without having to reconstruct history.
- **Claude never modifies the Needlist from signup screenshots, roster generation, or raid outcomes — only from explicit user instruction.** Triggers:
  - Player declares interest in an item → add the pairing. Insert a new row in alphabetical position if the item is not yet listed.
  - Player withdraws interest or obtains the item → remove the pairing. Drop the row if no competitors remain.
  - Player renamed → update every competitor cell to the new canonical name. Also invoked by the rename workflow in `reference/file-operations-manual.md`.
  - Player leaves the guild → remove them from every row; drop any row that empties.
- **Batch updates replace, not merge.** When a single user instruction covers current needs for several players at once, treat it as a full replacement for those players — **never** layer the new pairings on top of their existing entries. Steps, in order: (1) collect every player named in the update; (2) remove each of them from every Needlist row, dropping any row that empties; (3) apply the update's pairings, inserting new rows alphabetically when items aren't yet listed. Players not named keep their entries unchanged. A player named in the update with no items is valid — after step 2 they exit the Needlist entirely, correctly recording "I need nothing right now."
- **Invariants.** Items sorted alphabetically by name; competitors sorted alphabetically within each row; all names are canonical per `rules/04-players.md`.

**Applies to:** Karazhan only.

## Profession constraints

Some player professions affect raid group assignments.

### Enchanters — must be spread across Karazhan raid teams

Each Karazhan raid team must have exactly one enchanter. The guild's enchanters are:

| Player              | Character     |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Glaivemaster Baebay | BaeBay        |
| Kres/Dissi          | Kresniik      |
| Greg                | Ucannotpass   |

**Applies to:** Karazhan nights only (3 raid teams, 3 enchanters — one per team).

## Notes

- These constraints apply to both Karazhan (10-man) and Gruul+Mag (25-man) nights unless specified otherwise.
- If a constraint makes a valid composition impossible, flag it to the user before proceeding.
