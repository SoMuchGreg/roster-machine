# Rule 04 — Players

## General rules

- Some players can play **two specializations** (e.g., tank + DPS, healer + DPS). They may be assigned to either role as needed.
- Some players have **only one specialization**. They must always be assigned their one role.
- **Never assume** a player's class, specialization, or available roles. If unknown, ask the user.
- **Melee vs. Ranged DPS matters for Shamans and Druids.** Enhancement Shamans and Feral Druids are **melee DPS**. Elemental Shamans and Balance (Boomkin)
  Druids are **ranged/caster DPS**. This distinction affects raid composition and group assignments. Always check the spec icon in the signup screenshot to
  determine which DPS spec a Shaman or Druid is playing for that raid.
- **⚠️ Spec checks need extra care for hybrid classes.** Druids, Paladins, Shamans, and Priests can all flex across roles (tank/healer/DPS), and many of our
  players regularly switch spec from raid to raid. The spec icon in the signup screenshot is the **only authoritative source** for what spec a player is running
  on a given night.
    - **Druids** — flex across Feral tank, Feral DPS (melee), Balance (ranged DPS), Resto (healer). Past sets have been miscorded (e.g., 2026-04-08 Karazhan:
      Beaverfist and Jar were both initially recorded as Resto healers but actually ran Balance DPS).
    - **Paladins** — flex across Protection (tank), Holy (healer), Retribution (DPS). McJudgin in particular swaps role by raid format (tank in Karazhan, healer
      in 25-mans). Other paladins may swap between Holy and Ret.
    - **Shamans** — flex across Enhancement (melee DPS), Elemental (ranged DPS), Restoration (healer). The melee/ranged distinction also affects party group
      assignment.
    - **Priests** — flex across Shadow (DPS), Holy/Discipline (healer). A "Priest" entry tells you almost nothing about role on its own.
    - **Always inspect the spec icon for every hybrid-class signup, every raid.** Never carry forward a previous raid's spec assumption. When in doubt, ask the
      user before placing the player in a role.

## Raid spot priority

The **Priority** column in the roster tables below stores each player's raid spot priority as a single integer (1, 2, or 3). This file is the canonical place
for **per-player priority assignments**; what each value *means* and how it drives roster selection is defined in `rules/02-bench-rotation.md` → "Raid spot
priority (selection order)" — the single source of truth for the system's behavior. Do not duplicate the priority-level meanings here.

Priority is a property of the player, not of a specific raid. It changes only when the user explicitly updates it.

**Default priority for new players: `2`.** When a player who isn't already in the roster table appears in a Discord signup screenshot and the user provides
their class, add them to the Regular players table with priority `2` unless the user explicitly says otherwise. Do not guess priority `1` (always plays —
currently held only by the players in the Officers sub-table below) or priority `3` (last resort) without explicit user instruction.

## Known player roster

**Table ordering.** Rows in every roster sub-table below (Officers, Regular players, Former players) are sorted first by **class alphabetically**, then by **player name alphabetically** within each class. When adding or renaming a player, place the row in its correct sorted position rather than appending to the end. When a player leaves the guild, move their row out of Officers or Regular players into the Former players sub-table — do not leave a tombstoned row behind in the active tables.

**Row index (`#` column).** The leading `#` column in every sub-table is a continuous integer index that starts at `1` in Officers, continues through Regular players, and carries on into Former players (so every player in the file has a unique integer). It is derived from sort order, not a stable ID — whenever the order changes, or a row is added, removed, or moved between sub-tables, renumber every row from `1` so the sequence stays gap-free and monotonic.

### Former players

Players who have left the guild. Kept here so that old signup screenshots, set files, and changelog entries remain interpretable — never assign anyone from this table to a raid. Do **not** strike through names in this sub-table: the fact that the row lives under *Former players* already conveys that the player is no longer in the guild, and the strikethrough just makes the name harder to read when looking up an old reference.
